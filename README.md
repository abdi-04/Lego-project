# 🤖 LEGO MATLAB Project (ELE130)

This is a LEGO project report that I co-authored with another student using **LaTeX**.  
The goal of the project was to observe mathematical and physical concepts, as well as programming, in practice. 
The last two chapters of the report present a voluntary exercise in which we programmed a fully functional robot capable of performing specific tasks.

## 📘 Overview
- Programmed the robot using MATLAB  
- Applied concepts from mathematics, physics, and programming  
- Analyzed performance and documented the results

## 📄 Report
The full report is included in this repository as a PDF file. The report is written in norwegian.

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- MATLAB  
- LEGO Mindstorms EV3
- LEGO pieces 
- LaTeX  

## 👥 Contributors
- Abdirahman Abdi Ibrahim
- Wijenthan Wijayaseelan

## 🧠 Lessons Learned
- Fundamentals of robotic control  
- Using MATLAB for practical engineering applications  
- Collaboration and structured documentation using LaTeX
