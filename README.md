# 🤖 LEGO MATLAB Project (ELE130)

This is a LEGO project report that I co-authored with another student using **LaTeX**.  
The goal of the project was to build and program a LEGO robot capable of performing specific tasks.

## 📘 Overview
- Programmed the robot using MATLAB  
- Applied concepts from mathematics, physics, and programming  
- Analyzed performance and documented the results

## 📄 Report
The full report is included in this repository as a PDF file.

## ⚙️ Tools Used
- MATLAB  
- LEGO Mindstorms EV3  
- LaTeX  

## 👥 Contributors
- Abdirahman Abdi Ibrahim
- Wijenthan Wijayaseelan

## 🧠 Lessons Learned
- Fundamentals of robotic control  
- Using MATLAB for practical engineering applications  
- Collaboration and structured documentation using LaTeX
